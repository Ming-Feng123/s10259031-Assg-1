# JudoCraft
I created a website called JudoCraft to serve as a website for judokas to purchase their training equipments or judo related items online with ease. This website is a haven for those that might not have the particular store brands in their country for example, Singapore does not have official stores that sell Mizuno GIs which forces people to either buy it online or wait till they go to Japan. 
With this website, judokas can get their high quality items without worry of it being fake, or getting scammed.
## Design process
As a judoka myself in Singapore, i have had many instances where the Gi that i want to buy is not available in Singapore and have to resort to waiting for someone to go Japan and get it for me. I have many training friends who have had the same issue as well. Therefore, i decided to make this website so that other judokas who have or are facing this issue would have a way to get their desired Gi.
